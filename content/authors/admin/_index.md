I am a newly admitted PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stony Brook University and am working with the [PragSec Lab](https://www.securitee.org/lab.html) headed by [Nick Nikiforakis](https://www.securitee.org/). My current research interests include web security, distributed systems, and algorithms.

In my free time, I enjoy reading and urban dancing.
